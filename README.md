# Hey 

### I'am **Thomas**, a junior developer who loves playing with data and challenging himself with new coding projects



My background turns around the cultural and the touristic sectors as writting historical notes, promoting guided tours or setting up lots of events. My passion about traveling and meeting foreign cultures drives me to Australia where I expatriate myself for two years and then to other Asian & Pacific countries. Due to the outbreak, I stop my travel-adventures and settle down in Brussels where I write a new page and focus on a new challenge at [BeCode](https://becode.org/). Coding was obviousness ! I have always been attracted by creating web applications and experienced throw several projects as for a cultural association during my university studies, or for developping the professionnal activity of friend and some personal one. 

## Some surprising skills

- History addict. I've study Early Modern Period at Univeristy. Do you have a question about how was the tourism in the 18th century. Grab a seat, I can tell you a lots about it. 
- I like trekking ! It's an active way to get out in the wild and exploring the nature in a friendly way. I just need to grab my backpack with some gears and food and let's go ! After a full day of hiking I just want to rest, have some nice food and building the camp site on a stunning spot.  
- I'am also a boardgame addict ! Rolling dice, drafting cards and establishing the best strategy to make a huge win move ! This addiction drives me with some friends to create a NPO focus on boardgames presenting once a month.
